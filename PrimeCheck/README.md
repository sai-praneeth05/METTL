# Check Whether a Number Is Prime

## Problem Statement
Write a Java program to check whether a given integer number is a **prime number** or not.

A prime number is a number that has **exactly two distinct positive divisors**: 1 and itself.

---

## Logic Description
- The program uses a method with a parameter and no return value.
- A loop checks divisibility of the number starting from 2 up to half of the number.
- If the number is divisible by any value in this range, it is not a prime number.
- A flag variable is used to determine whether the number is prime or not.
- Based on the flag value, an appropriate message is printed.

## Input
- An integer value `n`

---

## Output
- Prints whether the given number is a **prime number** or **not a prime number**
