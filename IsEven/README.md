# Check Whether a Number is Even

## Problem Statement
Write a Java program to check whether a given integer number is **even** or **odd**.

A number is said to be **even** if it is divisible by 2 without any remainder. Otherwise, it is considered **odd**.

---

## Logic Description
- The program uses a method with parameters and a return type.
- If the number is divisible by 2 (`n % 2 == 0`), the method returns `2`.
- Otherwise, the method returns `1`.

---

## Input
- An integer value `n`

---

## Output
- Returns `2` if the number is even
- Returns `1` if the number is odd
