# Check Whether a Number is Odd

## Problem Statement
Write a Java program to check whether a given integer number is **odd** or **even**.

A number is said to be **odd** if it is **not divisible by 2**. Otherwise, it is considered **even**.

---

## Logic Description
- The program uses a method with parameters and a return type.
- If the number is **not divisible by 2** (`n % 2 != 0`), the method returns `2`, indicating the number is odd.
- Otherwise, the method returns `1`, indicating the number is even.

---

## Input
- An integer value `n`

---

## Output
- Returns `2` if the number is odd
- Returns `1` if the number is even
