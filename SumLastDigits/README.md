# Sum of Last Digits of Two Given Numbers

## Problem Statement
Write a Java program to find the **sum of the last digits** of two given integer numbers.

The program should work correctly for both **positive and negative** numbers.

---

## Logic Description
- The program uses a method with parameters and a return type.
- The last digit of each number is obtained using modulo operation (`% 10`).
- `Math.abs()` is used to ensure the last digits are positive.
- The sum of the two last digits is returned.

## Input
- Two integer values `n1` and `n2`

---

## Output
- Returns the **sum of the last digits** of the given numbers
