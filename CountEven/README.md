# Count Even Numbers Among Five Given Numbers

## Problem Statement
Write a Java program to count how many numbers are **even** among five given integer values.

A number is considered **even** if it is divisible by 2 without any remainder.

---

## Logic Description
- The program uses a method with parameters and a return type.
- The five input numbers are stored in an array.
- The program iterates through the array and checks each number.
- If a number is divisible by 2, it is counted as even.
- The final count of even numbers is returned.

## Input
- Five integer values `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, `n4`, and `n5`

---

## Output
- Returns the **count of even numbers** among the five inputs
