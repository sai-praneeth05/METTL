# Factorial of a Number

## Problem Statement
Write a Java program to find the **factorial** of a given non-negative integer number.

The program should calculate the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the given number.

---

## Logic Description
- The program uses a method with parameters and a return type.
- A variable `fact` is initialized to `1`.
- A `for` loop runs from `1` to `n`, multiplying `fact` with the current loop index in each iteration.
- The final value of `fact` is returned as the factorial of the number.

---

## Input
- A single non-negative integer `n`

---

## Output
- Returns the **factorial** of the given number
