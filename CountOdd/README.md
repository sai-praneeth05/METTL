## Problem Statement
Write a Java program to count how many numbers are **odd** among five given integer values.

A number is considered **odd** if it is not divisible by 2.

---

## Logic Description
- The program uses a method with parameters and a return type.
- The five input numbers are stored in an array.
- The program iterates through the array and checks each number.
- If a number is not divisible by 2, it is counted as odd.
- The final count of odd numbers is returned.

## Input
- Five integer values `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, `n4`, and `n5`
